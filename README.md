# Real estate commute times browser extension

Finding a nice place to live in when you're renting is hard.
If you want to (or have to) commute with public transport, *it's even harder*.

For each place you find, you have to go to Google Maps, copy the address, pick a few destinations like 
your job, university, family's place... and then compare the times.

It can be automated, though, which this simple working demo shows.



## Building

Before you build this, make sure you've filled:

* Google Maps API key
* Destinations to calculate times for

in the source code (`realestate-commute-times.js`).

### Installation

See [Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox]).
